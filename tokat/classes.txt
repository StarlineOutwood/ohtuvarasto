Monks do dope monk shit
rangers are kind of briken in the system, but i really like the idea
rogues are edgy
barbarians rage
clerics heal unless you are jester
wizards learn the maguc, warlocks sell their soul and sorceres are just the gifted bastards that dont need to do shit
fighters are cool but boring
druids are hippies
